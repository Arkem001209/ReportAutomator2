# ReportAutomator2

This is a first iteration of a new report generator. It will be used to collect data from our Xplan CRM system and populate an excel file with this data in a rpesentable format for the client. The program uses API calls to scrape financial data on clients 
and arranges them in an Excel format. Currently the program just pastes into an excel file.
The next steps will be to write code to map data into a chosen format and to specify which client data I want to collect from Xplan.
Once this project is finished there will be no need for current outdated VBA structure and will work towards pushing LWP into the forefront of financial technology in the wealth management industry.
